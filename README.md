```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log('hello world!');
}
```

## Presenting

* Click 'Present' in navbar
  * Use arrow keys to navigate through slides
  * Press \`escape\` to switch back to 'edit' mode
  * Most standard wireless remotes are supported
* Slides will be persisted even if you navigate away from site

Note: this is a note
it won't be rendered

## Tables

* Tables are supported as well

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Note: Three dashes "-" will delineate a new slide, so avoid them in tables or your presentation will be broken up!
