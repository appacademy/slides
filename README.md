## Code Snippets

- Supports in-line code `snippets` with backticks
- Or, use multi-line code blocks with automatic syntax highlighting:

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log("hello world!");
}
```

## Tables

- Tables are supported as well

| Tables        |      Are      |   Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | -----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | \$1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   \$12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    \$1 |

## Presenting

Click the screen icon in the navbar or press F5.

- Use arrow keys (or PgUp/PgDn) to navigate through slides.
- Home/End go to the beginning/end of the deck.
- Press Escape or F5 to switch back to edit mode.
- Most standard wireless remotes are supported.

## Slides Preview

- The markdown is automatically converted into slides that you can see and scroll through to the right.
- When the editor is not selected, the same keyboard shortcuts work to advance the slide as in presentation mode.
- You can also click on slides to select them.

Note:

- Anything after `Note:` is not rendered in the slide.
- But it does show up in the notes preview section below.

---

## State is Synced

- The slides are persisted even if you navigate away from site.
- All changes are immediately synced to all open tabs, including which slide is active.
- This means you can view and edit your slides in a separate window while your present.

## Cursor Position Syncs

When the **Sync editor position** option is checked...

- The current slide adjusts to follow your cursor when editing.
- The text for the current slide is highlighted in the editor when it is not active.
- **Warning:** this can have some _weird_ consequences if you have two edit views syncing their position at the same time.
